# Unemployment-Analysis-with-Python
This project performs an in-depth analysis of unemployment trends using real-world data. With the help of Python libraries, we explore, visualize, and understand how unemployment rates have varied across different regions, time periods, and demographics.

🎯 Objective

To analyze and visualize unemployment trends in order to identify patterns, regional disparities, and time-based fluctuations. This project aims to derive insights that can help policymakers, researchers, and the public understand unemployment dynamics better.
